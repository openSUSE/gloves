YaST++
------

Long term goal
--------------

Provide an alternative for the YaST business logic using up-to-date techonology.
Provide clean, understandable and common API for system configuration related
tasks, not only for YaST.


Main advantages of YaST++ compared to YaST
------------------------------------------

1. Using modern and well-known language

    We chose Ruby mostly because of
        - wide user community
        - good testing framework
        - good knowledge inside SUSE

    YaST is mostly written in YCP language, which is not developed any more and
    is known only to inner circle of initiates.

    Popular language not only helps development, but (primarily!) the
    maintenance.

2. Optional role based access management

    The architecture uses Policykit to define rights to the configuration tasks
    and check if current user has such right.

    Architecture backend uses D-Bus services that are actually accessing the
    system. Those services have rights of system administrator (root).

    Only if user is allowed to perform certain task, D-Bus service is started
    and action is done. D-Bus is used only for non-root access system, so
    there is no speed penalty for Classical YaST usage (run as root).

3. Better modularity

    By splitting the business logic part (YLib) from UI (Qt, WWW) and from
    system access (config-agents), modules that borrow functionality from
    other ones do not need to import (install) their UI.

    In the end, there should be smaller space requirements for situations when
    only part of YaST++ stack should be installed (e.g. WebYaST usage).


The architecture in short
-------------------------

Look at doc/architecture.svg diagram.

YaST++ consist of two new layers: YLib and Config Agents.

YLib is the public library layer. It provides simple API for those who want to
configure the system.

The API consists of these functions

    read ({})           - read function: takes one hash argument and returns
                          hash
    add ({}, {})        - 
    modify ({}, {})     - 
    delete ({}, {})     - those modify functions take 2 hash argument (first is
                          meant e.g. for object specification, second contains
                          the actual data to be written)
    propose ({})        - propose new configuration (note: not yet decided if it
                          should be in ylib or library above it, that just take
                          input and return map for ylib modules)

See https://github.com/yast/yast--/wiki/YLib-Use-Cases for more about YLib API.

Config agent works with system, by which we mean it either modifies files or
runs scripts.

There are 2 kinds of config agents

    - File agents handle files
    - Script agents are running the scripts

There are 2 defined policies for file agents (rights to read and write) and
one for script agents (right to execute).

The implementation of config agents should very simple, basically file agents
only parse a file they manage and return its structure as hash (for read
command) and write the new contents in case of write command. Script agent just
executes its script with the given arguments. Config agents do not have any
knowleadge about the data semantics, this is the task for YLib library.

Using YaST++
------------

    YLib can be imported for any ruby code, see

        yast++lib-kerberos-client/examples/kerberos_conf for an example

    YLib can be directly used from current YaST modules using
    yast2-ruby-bindings

        yast++lib-kerberos-client/examples/kerberos-example.ycp for simple
        example of calling YLib

        yast--/yast/kerberos-client for whole YaST module where system access
        is replaced with YLib calls

    TODO: usage from WebYast


What YLib developer should know
-------------------------------

What Config Agent developer should know
---------------------------------------

We have a code generator. Developer only need to fill up read/write or execute
method that do real action and fill test for such functionality. See
tutorial.txt for details.

Every function gets a Hash as input and must return Hash. Hash can contain only
primitive types which support dbus (numbers, strings, arrays, hashes) also nil
and Symbol values cannot pass dbus, so it is forbidded and should be encoded to
other type.

Raising an exception is safe. Exception is handled and on front side it raise
DbusClient::BackendException. For own exception as base should be used
ConfigAgentService::BackendException and on front register exception as shown
for InsufficientPermission one.

Code runs as root, so expect an intensive security review.
Every config agent include Logger via log method (usage log.info "value"). Log
output is available at /var/log/config_agent/services.log (or under respective
chroot if run in chroot).


Defining Policies
-----------------

    See doc/org.opensuse.config_agent.pkla for policy config file example.
