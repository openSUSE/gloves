yast++ Tutorial!
================

First of all you need checkout the sources and install needed the ruby gems:
# git clone git@github.com:yast/yast--.git

Follow the README file, doc/architecture.txt document and install needed dependencies:
# sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/openSUSE_12.1/devel:languages:ruby:extensions.repo
# sudo zypper in rubygem-ruby-augeas rubygem-open4 rubygem-packaging_rake_tasks rubygem-ruby-dbus

Run rake install from the yast-- directory:
# sudo rake install

First Step: Run an example:
# ./yast++lib-country/examples/keyboard_conf

Next Step: Own yast++ module:
It's time to write your own yast++ module now. We'll start with the config_agent, the low level part:
# mkdir config_agent-windowmanager
# cd config_agent-windowmanager

Use the config agent generator to generate the skeleton for your code:
# config-agent-generator file /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager

Add some lines of code to the skelleton:
# vi services/file/windowmanager.rb
Add your code to the read() and write() functions. You might want to use augeas for config file reading/writing.
Make sure not to return nil values as they are not supported by dbus and will result in an error message
like "Message did not receive a reply (timeout by message bus) (DBus::Error)" 

Next part is the ylib:
# mkdir yast++lib-windowmanager
# cd yast++lib-windowmanager
# mkdir ./lib/y_lib

Create your code, use another module for copy&paste:
# vi ./lib/y_lib/windowmanager.rb

And finally the last part: An example application
copy&paste is your friend :-)   
# mkdir examples
# vi examples/windowmanager_conf

It's time to play...FINAL JEOPARDY! 
# ./examples/windowmanager_conf

Hopefully everything works fine. Otherwise see the logs for debugging in
 /var/log/config_agents/*
