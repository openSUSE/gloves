# # Type:        list(bios,yes,no)
# # Default:     bios
# NumLock on? ("yes" or "no" or empty or "bios" for BIOS setting)

# Disable CAPS LOCK and make it a normal Shift key?
# (Ctrl Caps Lock will still toggle Caps Lock functionality)
# Note that you need to tweak the xkb maps or use xmodmap

# keycode 0x42 = Shift_L Shift_L

# # Default:
# ttys for the above settings
# Example: "tty1 tty2"
# "" for tty's 1-6
# Compose tables to be loaded.
# Compose tables are good for producing characters, which can not
# be directly input from your keyboard, such as characters with
# accents, currency signs, ...
# Please read /usr/share/doc/packages/kbd/README.SuSE for an
# explanation.
# You may leave this variable empty (default compose table from kernel
# or KEYTABLE will be used then -- most keyboard maps don't have a
# compose table, though)
# More than one compose table can be given. For a selection of possible
# tables see /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/include/compose.*
# You can give more than one compose table, but only the last one will
# determine the compose combinations.
# The word "clear" has a special meaning:
# Your compose table will be cleared, before more compose symbols are
# added.
# The files compose.winkeys and shiftctrl may be used to map the
# <compose> key to the W*n menu key and Shift-Ctrl, respectively,
# on a PC keyboard.
# A typical setting for Latin1 users (with a PC keyboard) may be
# COMPOSETABLE="clear winkeys shiftctrl latin1.add"
# For latin2, this would be
# COMPOSETABLE="clear winkeys shiftctrl latin2"
# A typical setting for sb. with a character set, where a matching
# compose table is missing (but with a PC keyboard), would be
# COMPOSETABLE="winkeys shiftctrl"
# The YaST-internal identifier of the attached keyboard.
