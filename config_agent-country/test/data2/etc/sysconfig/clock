# if your clock runs that way.
# # Description: Write back system time to the hardware clock
# # Type:		yesno
# # Default:		yes
# Is set to "yes" write back the system time to the hardware
# clock at reboot or shutdown. Usefull if hardware clock is
# much more inaccurate than system clock.  Set to "no" if
# system time does it wrong due e.g. missed timer interrupts.
# If set to "no" the hardware clock adjust feature is also
# skipped because it is rather useless without writing back
# the system time to the hardware clock.
# # Type:		string(Europe/Berlin,Europe/London,Europe/Paris)

# # Command:		/sbin/refresh_initrd
# Timezone (e.g. CET or Asia/Tokyo). The value should correspond
# to the contents of the /etc/localtime file and is for internal
# YaST use; changing this setting will not make SuSEconfig update
# the /etc/localtime file, YaST does that or you will need to do
# this manually by calling zic -l.
